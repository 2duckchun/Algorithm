/*
Objectives
* Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far
* Implement merge sort
* implement quick sort
* implement radix sort

WHY LEARN THIS?
* The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
* Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!

FASTER SORTS
* There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n2) to O(n log n)
* There's a tradeoff betweeen efficiency and simplicity
* The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
* Let's dive in!
